# JS for everyone

## 🏃‍♂️ Simple start

2. **`npm run dev`** at the root
3. open **`http://localhost:7500/`**


## 🏃‍♂️ What have been done

According to the assignment:

1) In the FighterService class, I created a method to get detailed information about a fighter (function getFighterInfo).
2) I implemented the createFighterPreview function to display the selected fighters with their data such as name, health, damage and defense power.
3) Created the fight function which return a Promise with information about the winner.
4) Implemented logic of common attacks and blocks for each fighter.
5) Created logic to calculate hit and block powers with critical and dodge chances.
6) Created logic of special critical strikes that cannot be blocked.
7) Created a delay logic for special critical strikes.


My own features that I have implemented
1) Changed the style of the right fighter. They are now looking at each other, and stand "face to face".
2) Changed the styles for the health bars in the battle status section of the arena. The right health point bar is now attached to the right corner of its container, and when the other fighter took damage, the health point bar decreases to the right. It looks really cool, like in Mortal Combat, I'd say.
3) Implemented the logic of starting a new battle after closing the modal window of the winner. This will allow users to play again if they want to.

## 💡 PS
It was a very interesting and challenging assignment for me. I hope that I have coped with it and that you will appreciate my work high.
